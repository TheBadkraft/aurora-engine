**Anvil** — the data language that causes JSON, YAML, and TOML to admit they're embarrassing failures at ... everything - readability, portability, expressiveness, and speed.

Anvil is a **zero-copy**, **typeless**, **blazing-fast** modeling language (AML dialect) built in pure Java 21.  
It parses real-world 6–8 KB modded configs in **~120 µs warm**, with **zero heap allocations** for skipped content.

One JAR. No dependencies. No apologies.

## Core Features (AML – Anvil Modelling Language)

### Rich Literals
- **Strings** – double quotes only (`"stone"`) – because single quotes are for people who hate consistency  
- **Hex values** – `#FF5733` (2–8 digits) and classic `0xDEADBEEF`  
- **Bare literals** – unquoted identifiers (`stone`, `minecraft:dirt`, `needs_iron_tool`) – because quotes are for cowards  
- Full scientific notation, booleans, `null`, and mixed-type collections – because types are a suggestion

### Attributes – Metadata That Doesn’t Suck
```aml
@[mod="anvil_test", version="1.0.0", debug=true]
@[author="Badkraft", generated="2025-12-01"]
```
- Multiple top-level `@[…]` blocks allowed (unlike certain *other* formats that choke on two lines)  
- Attach to statements, objects, arrays, tuples  
- Pure metadata – parser doesn’t care, your runtime does

### Inheritance – For Engineers, By Engineers
```aml
base_block @[tier=1] := { hardness := 2.0 }

derived_block : base_block @[tier=2] := { hardness := 5.0 }
```
- `base` → `derived`, not "parent-child" ... learn the terms 
- Parser records the relationship **flat** – no merging during parse  
- Resolution and topology construction happen **at runtime** when the consumer asks  
- Base does **not** need to appear before derived – forward references allowed  
- Single inheritance only – because multiple inheritance is a war crime

### Collections Done Right
```aml
// Arrays – order matters
tags := [ "flammable", "occludes" ]

// Tuples – fixed size, semantic grouping
position := (100.5, 64.0, -200.3)

// Objects – because curly braces aren’t just for JavaScript anymore
player := {
    name := "Notch"
    health := 20.0
    inventory := [ (stone, 64), (diamond, 1) ]
}
```

### Near-Zero-Copy Parser
- Scans source without materializing strings unless explicitly requested  
- Whitespace and comments skipped in a single pass  
- Immutable sealed hierarchy of `record` types  
- Thread-safe, allocation-minimal, GC-friendly

## Java API (v0.1.7 Fluent, Intuitive)

Given the following config:
```anvl
//	server.anvl
#!aml
@[version=2, experimental]

server @[core] := {
    name := "Anvil Survival"
    port := 25565
    motd := "Forged in fire."
}

world @[seed=1337] := {
    spawn @[respawn] := (0, 64, 0)
    rules @[hardcore] := [
        "pvp", "keepInventory=false", "naturalRegeneration=true"
    ]
}

motd @[pinned] := {
    readme := @md`*** # Anvil Server Forged in fire. Built to last.***`
}

player := ("Notch", 100, true)
```
You should be able to use the object topography intuitively, naturally, organically ... the way _it should be_.

```java
AnvilServer server = AnvilServer.load("server.anvl");

System.out.println("Starting " + server.serverName());
System.out.println("Port: " + server.port());
System.out.println("MOTD: " + server.motd());

Vector3i spawn = server.spawnPoint();
System.out.printf("Spawn: %d, %d, %d%n", spawn.x(), spawn.y(), spawn.z());

System.out.println("Game rules:");
server.gameRules().forEach(System.out::println);

System.out.println("Readme:");
System.out.println(server.readmeMarkdown());

if (server.isHardcore()) {
    System.out.println("⚔ Hardcore mode enabled");
}

if (server.isExperimental()) {
    System.out.println("Warning: Running experimental build");
}
```

**Anvil** – because your data deserves better than 1998.
