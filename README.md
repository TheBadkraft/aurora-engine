**Anvil** — the data language that causes JSON, YAML, and TOML to admit they're embarrassing failures at ... everything - readability, portability, expressiveness, and speed.

Anvil is a **zero-copy**, **typeless**, **blazing-fast** modeling language (AML dialect) built in pure Java 21.  
It parses real-world 6–8 KB modded configs in **~120 µs warm**, with **zero heap allocations** for skipped content.

One JAR. No dependencies. No apologies.

## Core Features (AML – Anvil Modelling Language)

### Rich Literals
- **Strings** – double quotes only (`"stone"`) – because single quotes are for people who hate consistency  
- **Hex values** – `#FF5733` (2–8 digits) and classic `0xDEADBEEF`  
- **Bare literals** – unquoted identifiers (`stone`, `minecraft:dirt`, `needs_iron_tool`) – because quotes are for cowards  
- Full scientific notation, booleans, `null`, and mixed-type collections – because types are a suggestion

### Attributes – Metadata That Doesn’t Suck
```aml
@[mod="anvil_test", version="1.0.0", debug=true]
@[author="Badkraft", generated="2025-12-01"]
```
- Multiple top-level `@[…]` blocks allowed (unlike certain *other* formats that choke on two lines)  
- Attach to statements, objects, arrays, tuples  
- Pure metadata – parser doesn’t care, your runtime does

### Inheritance – For Engineers, By Engineers
```aml
base_block @[tier=1] := { hardness := 2.0 }

derived_block : base_block @[tier=2] := { hardness := 5.0 }
```
- `base` → `derived`, not "parent-child" ... learn the terms 
- Parser records the relationship **flat** – no merging during parse  
- Resolution and topology construction happen **at runtime** when the consumer asks  
- Base does **not** need to appear before derived – forward references allowed  
- Single inheritance only – because multiple inheritance is a war crime

### Collections Done Right
```aml
// Arrays – order matters
tags := [ "flammable", "occludes" ]

// Tuples – fixed size, semantic grouping
position := (100.5, 64.0, -200.3)

// Objects – because curly braces aren’t just for JavaScript anymore
player := {
    name := "Notch"
    health := 20.0
    inventory := [ (stone, 64), (diamond, 1) ]
}
```

### Near-Zero-Copy Parser
- Scans source without materializing strings unless explicitly requested  
- Whitespace and comments skipped in a single pass  
- Immutable sealed hierarchy of `record` types  
- Thread-safe, allocation-minimal, GC-friendly

## Java API (v0.1.6 – Fluent & Minimal)

```java
import dev.badkraft.anvil.api.Anvil;

// One-liner load
AnvilRoot root = Anvil.load(Paths.get("blocks.aml"));

// Root-level access
Value block = root.valueFor("derived_block");
boolean isObject = root.hasObject("player");
Attribute tier = root.getAttribute("tier");

// Namespace & context attributes
String ns = root.namespace();
Value.Attributes ctxAttrs = root.getAttributes();
```

Full type-safe convenience layer (`AnvilObject`, `AnvilArray`, etc.) coming in **0.1.7**.

**Anvil** – because your data deserves better than 1998.
